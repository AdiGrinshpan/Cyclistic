# Analysis Project - Cyclistic

This analysis project is the accumulation of the "Google Data Analytics Certificate" course.

For this analysis i was given a task - to give my recommendations on how to convert casual users to membership users for a fictional bicycle share company ("Cyclistic").

I shall work through all the analysis phases : Ask , Prepare , Process , Analyze , Share and Act.

I'll be using MySQL SHELL and MySQL Workbench for data preperation, cleaning and analysis. and Tableau for visualization.

- My complete report is available in the attached **"Full_report"** file.

- For further in-depth understanding of the scenario -please refer to the **"Case_Study-1"** file .

- You can find my full SQL queries in the **"Cyclistic_SQL"** file .

- also attached is the Tableau Dashboard for the project - **"Dashboard_1"** file .

Thank you, Adi.
