# Analysis Project - Cyclistic

This analysis project is the accumulation of the "Google Data Analytics Certificate" course.

For this analysis i was given a task - to present my top recommendations on how to convert casual users to membership users for a fictional bicycle share company ("Cyclistic").

I shall work through all the analysis phases : Ask , Prepare , Process , Analyze , Share and Act.

I'll be using MySQL SHELL and MySQL Workbench for data preperation, cleaning and analysis. and Tableau for visualization.

- My complete report is available in the attached [**"Full_report"**](Full_report.pdf) file.

- For further in-depth understanding of the scenario -please refer to the [**"Case_Study-1"**](Case-Study-1.pdf) file .

- You can find my full SQL queries in the [**"Cyclistic_SQL"**](Cyclistic_SQL.sql) file .

- also attached is the Tableau Dashboard for the project - [**"Dashboard_1"**](Dashboard_1.png) file .

Thank you, Adi.
